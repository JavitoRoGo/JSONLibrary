# JSONLibrary

## A toolkit useful for working with JSON, both in local storage or from a server.

You can add this tool to your Swift project so you get the necessary code to parse JSON files that you have saved locally.

But it also provides you with the code to make it easy to do network calls to a remote server, both to retrieve a JSON file and to send data to the server.
